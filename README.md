# DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS COMPUTATIONAL PRACTICUM
Python GUI for analyzing numerical methods used for solving Initial Value Problem.
Methods used: Euler, Improved Euler, Runge-Kutta. GUI gives opportunity to analyze
convergence of these numerical methods, local and global truncation errors the 
possibility of changing the initial conditions
